## What is Atlas? :bulb:

Atlas provides a worry-free way to store your sensitive info (e.g. password hints).

Using logins and passcodes to access your secrets, and email alerts when your secrets are accessed you'll never have to worry about your valuable private info being exposed.

## How to use Google Book Search: :mag:

1) Sign up to Atlas if you haven't already. Pick a memorable PIN, but please don't pick 123456 or something!

1) Login using your email and password.

1) To write a new secret, click the 'Add New' button and fill in the fields. The title is what you'll see when the card is locked.

1) To unlock your secrets, hit the lock button on the card you want to reveal.

1) All secrets will unlock, but will only show one at a time to keep prying eyes away from all your info.

Alongside all this, you will receive an email alert letting you know someone has accessed your info, allowing you to take immediate action.


## Technical Info :page_facing_up:

Atlas is a MERN-stack app, taking advantage of how React allows for dynamic rendering to handle which cards are displayed.

Here are all the things we used:

MongoDB / Express.js / React.js / Node.js / Semantic-UI-react / Axios / Nodemailer / JSON Web Token / MD5 / Mongoose / Sweet Alerts

### Enjoy Atlas! :v:
